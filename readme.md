# Run ViperFx without rooting your Phone (kinda)

## What this is:
1. ViperFx on your Android without rooting it or voiding the warrenty/bootloader unlocking
2. A rooted virtualized enviorment seperate from your existing Android (using closed source Virtual Master)
3. Android 7.1 (Android 9/11 wouldn't root or run VFX correctly)

## What this IS NOT:
1. A system pipe for audio for all your Audio (only what you play in the VM gets piped)
2. Rooting/reflashing your device

## Who's it for?
1. Those who own a phone but can't root it (eg. North American Samsung S24)
   - and don't want to pay for a paid unlock or risk bricking it
2. Those who play music locally (FLAC, MP3) but want VFX
3. Cannot buy another phone at the present moment

(this is me)

## Streaming
 - Spotify
 - Tidal
 - Deezer
All opened correctly but I'll test streaming later

## Okay, but... why?
I don't know, I liked VFX on my rooted Tab but using a tablet for media seemed clunky to say the least and didn't want to carry another phone just for music. This is meant to be a temporary fix for people who cannot root their phone, until they can buy one they can. And a fun experiment as well
